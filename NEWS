surface-dynamics Change Log
===========================

.. current developments

v0.6.0
====================

**Added:**

* more configurable sql query printing
* stratum of meromorphic and higher order differentials

**Deprecated:**

* methods of Stratum (and subclasses AbelianStratum, QuadraticStratum):
  zeros(), genus(), nb_zeros(), nb_fake_zeros(), nb_poles()

**Fixed:**

* Fixed building with e-antic version 2.

* Fixed compatibility issues with SageMath 10.1.



v0.5.0
====================

**Added:**

* Added `environment.yml` file to install all dependencies of surface-dynamics with conda.
* power notation for flip sequence input

* symbolic matrix powers
* Masur-Veech volumes for connected components of minimal strata of Abelian differentials
* fix some issues with non-connected fat graphs

* method to compute the graph of saddle connections of a separatrix or cylinder diagram
* allow inclusion of jupyter notebooks (in markdown format) in
  the documentation

* add a notebook for the classification of rank 2 GL(2,R)-orbit
  closure in genus 3
* CylinderDiagram.cylinder_graph() and CylinderDiagram.homologous_cylinders()
* subspace of homology generated by saddle connections of a cylinder
  diagram

**Changed:**

* FatGraph has now a mutable flag and many more methods
* The project is now called `surface-dynamics`. It was already called like that
  on PyPI but now we are consistently using that name. Note that the Python
  package is still imported as `surface_dynamics` so no code changes should be necessary.

**Removed:**

* Dropped testing for most optional dependencies with SageMath 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3. The compiled dependencies (libeantic, libintervalxt) were not on conda-forge at the time and are therefore not available for the correct version of libflint. (Before we were using our nightly builds from the flatsurf channel but these are fairly unreliable and not maintained.)

**Fixed:**

* Fixed some typos in documentation and source code.
* Adapted CI setup on GitHub to changes in setup-miniconda.
* Fixed compilation with latest compilers & Cython.
* fix plotting towers of interval exchanges (problem with map)
* Fixed wrong ReST syntax in Python source code.
* Fixed wrong indentation style in Python source code.
* Adapted to changes in SageMath 9.6 and 9.7.
* Fixed documentation syntax, use `TESTS::` and `EXAMPLES::` like SageMath does.



v0.4.8
======

**Changed:**

* tutorial for interval exchange transformations

v0.4.7
======

**Changed:**

* Enumeration of fat graphs up to isomorphism (FatGraphs class).

**Fixed:**

* Make fat graph exhaustive generation works in all cases



v0.4.6
======

**Fixed:**

* Wrong computation of the stratum component for generalized permutation associated
  to quadratic differentials

* Fixed SEGFAULT in integral iet statistics

* problematic utf-8 encoding in README.rst that used to break the setup.py script

* undeclared utf-8 encoding in some Python files

**Changed:**

* Masur-Veech volume contribution of individual cylinder diagrams as multiple
  zeta values

* Density function for Rauzy induction

* Flip sequence for Rauzy induction. It is now possible to construct
  pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism without generating the Rauzy diagrams.

* Masur polygon (as a triangulated sage-flatsurf surface)

* Implementation of regular covers for faster computation of isotypical
  components

* conversion to and from pyintervalxt

v0.4.5
======

**Fixed:**

* fix .factor() for multivariate generating series

**Changed:**

* Topological recursion (Kontsevich and Masur-Veech volumes)

* up_to_symmetry option for cylinder diagrams

* more flexible statistics for interval exchange transformations

* fix orientation cover for Q(-1^4)

* erase_marked_points for interval exchange transformations

* generators for square tiled surfaces with cylinders of height one
