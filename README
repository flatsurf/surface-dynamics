Surface dynamics
================

The flatsurf package for SageMath adds functionality related to interval exchange
transformations, translation surfaces, mapping classes and more. It is
distributed as an external Python package. It installs on top of an existing
Sage installation.

This package is based on `SageMath <http://www.sagemath.org>`_ and relies heavily on:

* gmp or mpir for arbitrary precision arithmetic
* PARI/GP for number field computations
* GAP for finite groups representation and permutation groups

Prerequisites
-------------

Installing flatsurf requires a working Sage installation (with Cython and gcc).
Under most Linux distribution, you can install the package gcc
(it might even be already installed by default).
Under Mac OS X, get a working gcc by installing XCode from
the Mac App Store.

Installation
------------

The module is distributed on PyPI. You just need to run the following command::

    $ sage -sh -c "pip install surface_dynamics --user"

Alternatively, you can download the source code (see below).

Check
-----

After installing flatsurf, check that it works by launching Sage
and typing the following commands. You should get the same
output as below.::

	sage: from surface_dynamics.all import *
	sage: o = Origami('(1,2)','(1,3)')
	sage: print o
	(1,2)(3)
	(1,3)(2)
	sage: o.sum_of_lyapunov_exponents()
	4/3
	sage: o.lyapunov_exponents_approx()
	[0.33441823619678734]
	sage: o.veech_group()
	Arithmetic subgroup with permutations of right cosets
	 S2=(2,3)
	 S3=(1,2,3)
	 L=(1,2)
	 R=(1,3)
	sage: QuadraticStratum(1,1,1,1).orientation_cover()
	H_5(2^4)^odd

	sage: AbelianStrata(genus=3).list()
	[H_3(4), H_3(3, 1), H_3(2^2), H_3(2, 1^2), H_3(1^4)]

	sage: O = OrigamiDatabase()
	sage: q = O.query(("stratum","=",AbelianStratum(2)), ("nb_squares","=",5))
	sage: q.number_of()
	2
	sage: for o in q: print o, "\n"
	(1)(2)(3)(4,5)
	(1,2,3,4)(5)

	(1)(2)(3,4,5)
	(1,2,3)(4)(5)
