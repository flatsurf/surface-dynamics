def mean_and_std_dev(l):
    r"""
    Return the mean and standard deviation of the floatting point numbers in
    the list ``l``.

    The implementation is very naive and should not be used for large list
    (>1000) of numbers.

    .. NOTE::

        mean and std are implemented in Sage but are quite buggy!

    if len(l) == 1:
        d = 0
    else:
        d = sum((x-m)**2 for x in l) / (len(l)-1)
    return m,sqrt(d)
