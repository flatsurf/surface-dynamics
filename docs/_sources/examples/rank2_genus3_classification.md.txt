# Filtering Possible $\mathcal M$-Parallel Classes

The purpose of this notebook is to use Sage to assist in the classification of
rank 2 invariant subvarieties in strata of translation surfaces in genus 3.
This classification was already done through other methods by David Aulicino,
Duc Man Nguyen, and Alex Wright, but the methods described here, which is used
in my forthcoming PhD thesis, can be readily applied to other strata.

Assume $\mathcal M$ is an invariant subvariety in a stratum $\mathcal H$. We
will start with a horizontally periodic translation surface $M\in \mathcal M$.
A database for the possible cylinder diagrams for $M$ can be found in
`surface-dynamics`: see
[here](https://flatsurf.github.io/surface-dynamics/database.html). Here is an
example:

```{code-cell}
from surface_dynamics import CylinderDiagram

CylinderDiagram('(0,2)-(6) (1,4)-(3,5) (3,6)-(2,4) (5)-(0,1)')
```

![Drawing of above cylinder diagram](h211-c4-9-1.png)

Assume $M$ has a cylinder diagram with $n$ cylinders, and label them $0$ to
$n-1$ from left to right. Assume that these cylinders are partitioned into $m$
distinct $\cal M$-parallel classes, and we want to know all possible ways to do
this. The following function uses existing Sage functions to list all possible
partitions. The point of this notebook is to filter out some of these candidate
partitions by checking certain conditions. Although we won't use it here, you
can set `singletons=False` if you do not want to allow cylinders in an $\cal
M$-parallel class by themselves.

```{code-cell}
from sage.all import Partitions, SetPartitions

def list_partitions(n, m, singletons=True):
    """Return a list of all ways to partition the set [1..n] into m sets.

    If singletons==False, do not allow singleton sets.

    Each element of each partition is a frozen set.
    Each partition is an instance of
    `sage.combinat.set_partition.SetPartitions_setparts_with_category.element_class`."""

    partitions = []

    # Partition the integer n into m nonzero integers
    int_parts = Partitions(n, length=m).list()

    # Checks for singleton sets
    if not singletons:
        int_parts = [l for l in int_parts if not any([i == 1 for i in l])]

    # Converts integer partitions into set partitions
    for each_part in int_parts:
        partitions.extend(SetPartitions(range(n), each_part))
    return partitions

# Tests
assert len(list_partitions(5, 2, singletons=True)) == 15
assert len(list_partitions(6, 2, singletons=False)) == 25
assert len(list_partitions(6, 3, singletons=False)) == 15

list_partitions(4, 2)

# [{{0}, {1, 2, 3}},
#  {{0, 1, 2}, {3}},
#  {{0, 1, 3}, {2}},
#  {{0, 2, 3}, {1}},
#  {{0, 1}, {2, 3}},
#  {{0, 3}, {1, 2}},
#  {{0, 2}, {1, 3}}]
```


## Homologous Condition

The first condition is simply that two homologous cylinders must be in the same
$\cal M$-parallel class. `filter_homologous_condition` removes partitions that
do not satisfy this condition.


```{code-cell}
from surface_dynamics.flat_surfaces.twist_space import TwistSpace

def check_homologous_condition(cd, partition):
    """Check that homologous cylinders are in the same M-parallel class
    in `partition`."""
    tw = TwistSpace(cd)
    classes = tw.homologous_cylinders()
    for homology_class in classes:
        homology_class = frozenset(homology_class)
        for f_set in partition:
            intersection = f_set.intersection(homology_class)

            # Every set in the partition must contain the whole homology class
            # or none of it.
            if intersection != frozenset() and intersection != homology_class:
                return False
    return True

def filter_homologous_condition(cd, part_list):
    """rFilter out the partitions in part_list when
    check_homologous_condition=False."""
    return [part for part in part_list if check_homologous_condition(cd, part)]
```

### Example

For the cylinder diagram (0,3)-(0,5) (1,2)-(1,4) (4,6)-(3,7) (5,7)-(2,6),
the last two cylinders (numbered 2 and 3) are homologous. Thus, the remaining partitions
should be exactly those that put 2 and 3 in the same set.


```{code-cell}
part_list = list_partitions(4, 2)
cd = CylinderDiagram('(0,3)-(0,5) (1,2)-(1,4) (4,6)-(3,7) (5,7)-(2,6)')
filter_homologous_condition(cd, part_list)
# [{{0}, {1, 2, 3}}, {{0, 2, 3}, {1}}, {{0, 1}, {2, 3}}]
```


```{code-cell}
# Tests

cd = CylinderDiagram('(0,2,1)-(4,5) (3,5)-(0,2,1) (4)-(3)')
tw = TwistSpace(cd)
assert set(tw.homologous_cylinders()[0]) == {0, 1}
cd = CylinderDiagram('(0,3)-(0,5) (1,2)-(1,4) (4,6)-(3,7) (5,7)-(2,6)')
tw = TwistSpace(cd)
assert set(tw.homologous_cylinders()[0]) == {2, 3}
cd = CylinderDiagram('(0)-(2) (1,2,3)-(4,5) (4)-(3) (5)-(0,1)')
tw = TwistSpace(cd)
assert tw.homologous_cylinders() == []

part_list = list_partitions(3, 2)
cd = CylinderDiagram('(0,2,1)-(4,5) (3,5)-(0,2,1) (4)-(3)')
good_part = filter_homologous_condition(cd, part_list)
assert len(good_part) == 1
part_list = list_partitions(5, 2)
cd = CylinderDiagram('(0)-(2) (1)-(3) (2,4,3)-(5,6) (5)-(4) (6)-(0,1)')
good_part = filter_homologous_condition(cd, part_list)
assert len(good_part) == 15
cd = CylinderDiagram('(0,1)-(0,6) (2)-(5) (3)-(4) (4,5)-(1) (6)-(2,3)')
good_part = filter_homologous_condition(cd, part_list)
assert len(good_part) == 7
```

## Pants Condition

We define a **generalized pants** to be a pair of pants with potentially more
than two pant legs. This gives an equation in homology between the core curves
of the cylinders in the pants of the form $\gamma_1 = \sum_{i=2}^k \gamma_i$.
Because of this equation, we have that these cylinders cannot be contained in
exactly two distinct $\cal M$-parallel classes. To see this, recall that the
core curves of $\cal M$-parallel cylinders become colinear when projected to
the dual of the tangent space of $M$.  `filter_pants_condition` filters out
partitions that do not satisfy this condition.

In general, a homology relation between core curves of cylinders should give a
condition of partitions; this case and the previous one are both specific
examples of this.  It would be nice to have a more general function that finds
all homology relations, and determines all such conditions.


```{code-cell}

    """Find the M-parallel class in `partition` than contains `cylinder`.

        if cylinder in parallel_class:
            return i

    # If cylinder was not found in partition
    return None

    every cylinder in the pants

```

### Example

For cylinder diagram (0,3)-(5) (1)-(2) (2,5)-(3,4) (4)-(0,1), the first three cylinders {0, 1, 2} form a pair of pants.
Thus, they must all be in the same $\cal M$-parallel class or all be in different ones.
The only partition with two $\cal M$-parallel classes is thus {{0, 1, 2}, {3}}.


```{code-cell}
cd = CylinderDiagram("(0,3)-(5) (1)-(2) (2,5)-(3,4) (4)-(0,1)")
print(f"The pants of this cylinder diagram are: {find_generalized_pants(cd.cylinder_graph())}.")
# {frozenset({0, 1, 2})}

partitions = list_partitions(4, 2)

# [{{0, 1, 2}, {3}}]
```

## Standard Twist Condition

Now assume that $\cal M$ is rank 2 and $M$ has at least 3 $\cal M$-parallel
classes.  Let $\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3$ be the standard twists of these
classes, and $p$ be the projection from relative to absolution cohomology.  By
definition of rank, $p(\sigma_1), p(\sigma_2), p(\sigma_3)$ are in a 2
dimensional subspace of cohomology, so there must be a linear relation.  Up to
relabeling, the equation must be of the form $a_1p(\sigma_1) = a_2p(\sigma_2) +
a_3p(\sigma_3)$, where crucially $a_1,a_2,a_3>0$. Often, this equation has no
solutions, which rules out the partition.  We can use linear programming to
determine exactly when such an equation has a solution.  If $\cal M$ has more
than 3 $\cal M$-parallel classes, we have one such equation for any triple
(although many of these equations will be redundant).
`filter_standard_twist_condition` checks this condition.

### Examples

1. Since these exists an invariant subvariety of rank 2 containing a
   translation surface $M$ with cylinder diagram (0,3)-(5) (1)-(0) (2,5)-(3,4)
(4)-(1,2), whose $\cal M$-parallel classes are {{0, 3}, {1}, {2}}, it is a
sanity check that this partition has not been filtered out.


```{code-cell}
part_list = list_partitions(4, 3)
cd = CylinderDiagram("(0,3)-(5) (1)-(0) (2,5)-(3,4) (4)-(1,2)")
filter_standard_twist_condition(cd, part_list)
# [{{0, 3}, {1}, {2}}, {{0}, {1, 2}, {3}}]
```
2. The following is a corollary that we can use as a sanity check. If $M$
   contains exactly 3 $\cal M$-parallel classes, the dual of the equation
$a_1p(\sigma_1) = a_2p(\sigma_2) + a_3p(\sigma_3)$ gives an equation in
homology that contains the core curve of every cylinder of $M$. For (0)-(2)
(1,2,3)-(4,5) (4)-(3) (5)-(0,1), there is only one equation in homology between
{1,2,3}, so it cannot satisfy this condition with 3 $\cal M$-parallel classes.


```{code-cell}
part_list = list_partitions(4, 3)
cd = CylinderDiagram('(0)-(2) (1,2,3)-(4,5) (4)-(3) (5)-(0,1)')

## Leaf Condition

The final condition is quite specific but we include it because it is easy to
code up. It is from [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03303) Lemma 2.11.
Let $\cal M$ be an invariant subvariety with field of definition $\mathbb Q$
and rank at least 2. Assume $M$ is horizontally periodic and that the core
curves of the horizontal cylinders span a subspace of dimension at least 2 in
the dual of the tangent space. Furthermore, assume there is a simple horizontal
cylinder $C$ that is only adjacent to another cylinder $D$.  Then, $C$ and $D$
cannot be in the same $\cal M$-parallel class. `filter_leaf_condition` checks
this condition.

Define the **cylinder graph** as the directed graph, where vertices are
cylinders and the edges are saddle connections.  We call this the leaf
condition since $C$ is a leaf in the cylinder graph i.e. its only neighbor is
$D$.


```{code-cell}
def is_simple(cd, index):
    """Check if cylinder number `index` is simple."""
    cylinder = cd.cylinders()[index]
    if len(cylinder[0]) == 1 and len(cylinder[1]) == 1:
        return True
    return False

def find_leaves(digraph):
    """Return the tuples (leaf, neighbor) for all leaves of `digraph`.

    return leaf_neighbers

def check_leaf_condition(cd, partition):
    """Check for the following condition:

    """Filter out the partitions in part_list when check_leaf_condition=False.
    """
    return [part for part in part_list if check_leaf_condition(cd, part)]
```

### Example

In the cylinder diagram (0,1)-(0,2) (2)-(3) (3,4)-(1,5) (5)-(4), we see that
cylinder 3 is a leaf adjacent only to cylinder 2. Thus, they cannot be in the
same set.

```{code-cell}
part_list = list_partitions(4, 2)
cd = CylinderDiagram("(0,1)-(0,2) (2)-(3) (3,4)-(1,5) (5)-(4)")
filter_leaf_condition(cd, part_list)
# [{{0, 1, 2}, {3}}, {{0, 1, 3}, {2}}, {{0, 3}, {1, 2}}, {{0, 2}, {1, 3}}]
```

```{code-cell}
# Tests

cd = CylinderDiagram("(0,3)-(5) (1)-(2) (2,5)-(3,4) (4)-(0,1)")
good_part = filter_leaf_condition(cd, part_list)
assert len(good_part) == 7
```

## H(3,1)

We go through every cylinder diagram with $n$ cylinders in a component of a
stratum, and we check the partitions with $m$ $\cal M$-parallel classes. $\cal
H(3,1)$ has no rank 2 invariant subvarieties, so we would like to filter out as
many partitions as possible.


```{code-cell}
from surface_dynamics import AbelianStratum
from surface_dynamics.databases.flat_surfaces import CylinderDiagrams

def filter_partitions(cyl_diag_list, num_classes):
    """For each cylinder diagram in cyl_diag_list, list all partitions with
    num_classes number of classes and filter out the invalid ones.

    Stores the output in a dict of
    (cylinder diagram, list of equivalence classes)"""
    output = {}
    for cd in cyl_diag_list:
        part = list_partitions(len(cd.cylinders()), num_classes)
        part = filter_pants_condition(cd, part)
        part = filter_homologous_condition(cd, part)
        part = filter_leaf_condition(cd, part)
        part = filter_standard_twist_condition(cd, part)
        output[cd] = part
    return output
```

Among the four 4-cylinder diagrams and 2 $\cal M$-parallel classes, we rule out
two of the four cylinder diagrams. For the remaining ones, we only need to
consider one partition each.

For 3 $\cal M$-parallel classes, we rule out all possibilities.

## Printing Output

The following script goes through every component of strata in `strata`, every
cylinder diagram with at least 4 cylinders, and checks all partitions for at
least 2 $\cal M$-parallel classes. The output is saves to a folder called
`output`. This output is used in my thesis to classify rank 2 invariant
subvarieties in some genus 3 strata.
